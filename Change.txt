Change Management 
As described in the ITIL guidelines “change arises as a result of Problems, but many Changes can
come from proactively seeking business benefits such as reducing costs or improving services [8].” It
is felt that change management should have processes that remain separate from the day-to-day
running of the helpdesk. Whilst the need for certain changes may arise from an underlying system
problem with, it is more than likely that any change would be managed by an account manager, not by
a support technician. Implementing this kind of functionality may increase the complexity of the
system unnecessarily because current systems (be them software or human) already deal effectively
with this process.
