Incident Management
The CCTA state in [8] that “the primary goal of the Incident Management process is to restore normal
service operation as quickly as possible and minimise the adverse impacts on business” which must be
considered to be the main function of the helpdesk system because it is a fundamental role within IT
Support that incidents are managed effectively. When not appropriately dealt with, incidents will lead
to extended periods of decreased productivity or none whatsoever. The CCTA also state that “normal
operation” should be defined within the service level agreement [8]. Whilst this may be done at
Diagonal Solutions, there is nothing in their current system to ensure that the service level agreement
is met. Functionality in the new system support would ensure that the clients’ SLA agreements are
adhered to and that penalties imposed upon failing to reach these agreements are minimised. The
requirements capture has stated that this must be in the new system and, as such, forms part of the
minimum requirements of the project.
