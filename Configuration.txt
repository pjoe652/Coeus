Configuration Management
Central to much of the support that must be provided to customers is the configuration of their
network, servers and personal workstations. The customers who outsource all of their IT to Diagonal
Solutions may expect some form of management of their assets. The information that is held about
the customers systems is held in a Microsoft Word document, providing instructions on how to
remote control their systems and on what is installed on their servers and workstations. Although it
may be beneficial to hold this information together with the incident log (for example, to provide a
sound basis for support of an incident [8] or to identify the computer that a certain user has allocated
to them) it expands the scope of this project too far and would push timescales significantly. This is
something that could, and probably should be considered and implemented in future versions of the
helpdesk system but, because the documentation is already held elsewhere, it does not form part of the
minimum functional requirements for the successful day-to-day management of the helpdesk process.
