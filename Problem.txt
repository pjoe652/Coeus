Problem Management
Going a stage beyond incident management leads towards an enriched system capable of managing
problems – the underlying causes of many incidents. “The goal of Problem Management is to
minimise the adverse impact of Incidents and Problems on the business that are caused by errors
within the IT Infrastructure, and to prevent recurrence of Incidents related to these errors” [8]. By
incorporating problem management into the new system the project would be made much more
complex. It is felt that this area should be kept outside the scope of the project for several reasons.
Firstly, the number of calls that Diagonal Solutions receive is relatively few when compared with
many corporate helpdesks. Additionally, with few technicians communicating problems between
them very effectively by email this is not currently a priority. Whilst it is felt that having some form
of problem management mechanisms within the system, it is hoped that a well designed database will
easily support future application enhancements without fundamental system changes.
